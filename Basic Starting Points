Yeah, so I don't know much about JavaScript and I need to learn more real quick. However, the basic 
functions of the bot are:
    1. Force an Admin-Only operating state when given the command /squelch
    2. Return to normal operating state when given the command /release
I'll be helping again as soon as I can. Thanks, y'all!
